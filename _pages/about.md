I'm a master student in [Robotics, Cognition, Intelligence](https://www.tum.de/en/studies/degree-programs/detail/robotics-cognition-intelligence-master-of-science-msc) from Department of Computer Science, [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/). During my master study, I work closely with [Prof. Zeynep Akata](https://www.eml-munich.de/people/zeynep-akata) and [Prof. Nassir Navab](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/camp/members/cv-nassir-navab/nassir-navab/).

Prior to my master, I received my bachelorâ€™s Degree in [Jilin University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jilin_University)(2021). Between Sept. 2023 and Dec. 2024, I worked as a Research Intern in [Agile Robots AG](https://www.agile-robots.com/en/), Munich.

My current research interests focus on multi-modal learning and robotics vision. Recently, I am working on using diffusion models for realistic synthetic data generation.
